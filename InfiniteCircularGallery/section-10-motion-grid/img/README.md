# Motion Design GIFs

Add your motion design GIF files to this folder. They will be copied to `section-10-motion-grid/img/` during build.

**Required files:**
- motion.gif
- intro.gif
- gif (1).gif through gif (14).gif

Filenames with spaces are URL-encoded in the motion grid (e.g. `gif (1).gif` → `gif%20(1).gif`).
