            <p class="about-intro">Hello! First I would like to say thank you for taking the time to check out my page! Hopefully it's been <em>interesting so far</em>.</p>
            <p>I am Tevin Parboosingh, I am a Jamaican born multidisciplinary engineer. I came to the United States around a decade ago where I discovered my love for math and eventually computer science later on. I love to experiment and try new things, outside of technology and school, I have done everything from being a flight student, digital design, soccer, bike riding, modeling and list continues. Basically I love to try new things especially in nature.</p>
            <p>I do not like the cold at all, every year feels like it's my first time coming here. Oh yeah... I live in both New York and Connecticut, but in my free time you can find me in New York. As for Connecticut, this is where I try new things in terms of learning, expanding my skillset, one example being my interest in the quant finance space and how we can utilize machine learning to address problems.</p>
            <p>With that I am pursuing a PhD in AI from University of Cumberlands in which I'd be focusing mostly on the machine learning side application in Finance. Anywhooo!! without spilling all the beans I have much to show you about myself here! please scroll and continue to take a look</p>
