# Add model.glb and sky.jpg here

Section 5 (3D Model Environment) requires:

- **model.glb** – GLB/GLTF model (e.g. Hong Kong buildings from portfolio)
- **sky.jpg** – Equirectangular sky/environment texture

Place both files in this `public/` folder. They will be copied to the build output.

If missing, the viewer shows: "model.glb not found. Add to public/"
